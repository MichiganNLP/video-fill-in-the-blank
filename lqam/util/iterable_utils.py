    # We could return an iterator instead of a tuple, but maybe it's consumed later and the next chunk is yield.
    # In that scenario, there would be a bug because the main iterator wasn't consumed, so the chunks would be wrong.
    # So we force the consumption of the iterator here.
    #
    # The default value for `next` here is incredibly necessary, as it may otherwise raise a StopIteration.
    # StopIteration behavior inside generators and coroutines has changed since Python 3.7, and they're converted
    # into runtime errors, so they aren't interpreted as the iteration end anymore.
